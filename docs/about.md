# 🤓 **what?**
## *étiquette f (plural étiquettes)*
> ["ticket, memorandum, attach, stick, pierce, sting, to be sharp, goad, puncture, attach, nail"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A9tiquette#French)
> 1. tag, label 
> 2. prescribed behavior

It's curious how both meanings are a consequence of each other: we *name things around* to state and reinforce what they are or should be, and at the same time, we end up *influencing our own behaviors* mediated by these labels.

# 🤔 **why?**
### *TLDR: curiosity, technical challenge and of course organizing stuff.*

The initial spark for this project came from an ordinary manual [labeling device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256801648218535.html) that I bought to organize my workshop. I was ***VERY UPSET*** when I noticed that it was basically rubbish, getting broken and unusable after just a few operations. Just to imagine something made in another part of the world, travelling to me and breaking this way is unbelieavable.

This little plastic hook (circled in red) grabs a gated cog (the white plastic part below) to feed the tape forward. I tried to fix and reinforce it, but the failure was unavoidable because there seems to be a critical flaw in the project: it is too weak for the lateral force imposed.

I knew I could easily buy a brand new modern electronic thermal label printer ([such as this Brother model](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/pth110bp)), but something about the vintage embossed finish fascinated me. Also, these new models use expensive DRM [proprietary cartridges](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze335) that create a lot of trash after use, not to mention the recent models that are [DRM protected](https://hackaday.com/2022/03/30/freedmo-gets-rid-of-dymo-label-printer-drm/).


After all, even though the pressing mechanism was poorly made, the daisy wheel was pretty sturdy and sharp-printing. So I thought: can I build over its principles to create a functional device? If so, then why not make it *physical-digital?*


# 🤯 wider context & purpose

The context below was proven by several people:
1. embossed labels are deeply ingrained in culture, as well pointed by Dan Maloney and 
2. there are situations where a thermally printed or paper doesn't fit the needs
3. this is a cheap mass-produced device, meaning that lots of people around the world might have one at home or work;
4. these devices might be already broken: how many kilos of wasted plastic (plus the shipping impact)?
5. of course, these folks will be upset and in the end have their needs unaddressed.

These three factors made me think of E-TKT as more than a solution for myself, but to everyone. Creating an open source project is something I wanted to for a long time and this is why I put a lot of effort into, including this detailed documentation.


# 🤓 the exploratory side ***...anachronism*** 
...why bother mixing an archaic printing method with current automation and connectivity features? Because *why not?* It was a technological blind spot to be explored!

I've later realized that it was what I’ve been attracted to. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism):
> “An ***anachronism*** (from the Greek ἀνά ana, 'against' and χρόνος khronos, 'time') is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangements, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods”.

The point is: even though the process is digitalized, *the resulting label is totally old school* and there is no easy way of telling if it wasn't made in the traditional way.

## By combining simple and widely available 9mm embossing tapes in a reliable mechanism with modern connectivity, E-TKT rescues a ***would-be future that didn't happen***, and at the same time reduces the dependence on environmentally impacting DRM-enabled disposable cartridges.
