# 🤔 **why?**
### *TLDR: curiosity, technical challenge and of course organizing stuff.*

![motex3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/171213081-fbdf82dc-e752-46eb-81d8-d3f7b8e25f01.png)

The initial spark for this project came from an ordinary manual [labeling device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256801648218535.html) that I bought to organize my workshop. I was ***VERY UPSET*** when I noticed that it was basically rubbish, getting broken and unusable after just a few operations. This little plastic hook (circled in red) grabs a gated cog (the white plastic part below) to feed the tape forward. I tried to fix and reinforce it, but the failure was unavoidable because there seems to be a critical flaw in the project: it is too weak for the lateral resistance imposed.

I knew I could easily buy a brand new modern electronic thermal label printer ([such as Brother](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/pth110bp)), but something about the vintage embossed finish fascinated me. Also, these new models use expensive [proprietary cartridges](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze335) that create a lot of trash after use.

After all, even though the pressing mechanism was poorly made, the characters' carousel was pretty sturdy and sharp. So I thought: can I build over its principles to create a functional device? If so, then why not make it *physical-digital?*

...why bother mixing an archaic printing method with current automation and connectivity features? Because *why not?* It was a technological blind spot to be explored!


# *...anachronism* 🤓
I've later realized that it was what I’ve been attracted to. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism):
> “An ***anachronism*** (from the Greek ἀνά ana, 'against' and χρόνος khronos, 'time') is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangements, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods”.

### The point is: even though the process is digitalized, *the resulting label is totally old school* and there is no easy way of telling if it wasn't made in the traditional way.
