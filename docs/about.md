# 🤓 **what?**
## *étiquette f (plural étiquettes)*
> ["ticket, memorandum, attach, stick, pierce, sting, to be sharp, goad, puncture, attach, nail"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A9tiquette#French)
> 1. tag, label 
> 2. prescribed behavior

It's curious how both meanings are a consequence of each other: we *name things around* to state and reinforce what they are or should be, and at the same time, we end up *influencing our own behaviors* mediated by these labels.

# 🤔 **why?**
### *TLDR: curiosity, technical challenge and of course organizing stuff.*

The initial spark for this project came from an ordinary manual [labeling device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256801648218535.html) that I bought to organize my workshop. I was ***VERY UPSET*** when I noticed that it was basically rubbish, getting broken and unusable after just a few operations. Just to imagine something made in another part of the world, travelling to me and breaking this way is unbelieavable.

This little plastic hook (circled in red) grabs a gated cog (the white plastic part below) to feed the tape forward. I tried to fix and reinforce it, but the failure was unavoidable because there seems to be a critical flaw in the project: it is too weak for the lateral force imposed.

I knew I could easily buy a brand new modern electronic thermal label printer ([such as this Brother model](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/pth110bp)), but something about the vintage embossed finish fascinated me. Also, these new models use expensive DRM [proprietary cartridges](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze335) that create a lot of trash after use, not to mention that some other recent models are [DRM protected](https://hackaday.com/2022/03/30/freedmo-gets-rid-of-dymo-label-printer-drm/).


After all, even though the pressing mechanism was poorly made, the daisy wheel was pretty sturdy and sharp-printing. So I thought: can I build over its principles to create a functional device? If so, then why not make it *physical-digital?*


# 🤯 wider context & purpose

The context below was brought by several people I've been interacting during the development process:
1. **CULTURE:** embossed labels are deeply ingrained in culture, as well pointed by [Dan Maloney](https://deadhomersociety.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/quote-of-the-day-2406/) [(*HACKADAY*)](https://hackaday.com/2022/06/15/diy-automated-printer-kerchunks-out-classic-embossed-labels/) and a [spacestationkru](https://best-tv-shows.fandom.com/wiki/Labels_(Dexter%27s_Laboratory)) [(*reddit*)](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/vf8acb/comment/icvk1fe/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [agent_kater](https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor) [(*reddit*)](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/vf8acb/comment/icwgo76/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3);
2. **NICHE NEEDS:** there are situations where a paper, flat and/or thermally printed label doesn't fit the needs, let alone the need for the embossed relief;
7. **ERGONOMICS**: when there is no other way than using embossed labels, making them manually is a [straining process](https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprint/comments/vf8hrq/comment/icvjqvg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that might give the operator [repetitive strain injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury);
3. **REACH:** this is a cheap mass-produced device, meaning that lots of [people around the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/comments/vfa2nt/comment/id8e9f5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) might have one at home or [work](https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprint/comments/vf8hrq/comment/icuddop/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3);
4. **ENVIRONMENT:** these devices might be already broken: how many kilos of wasted plastic (plus the shipping impact)?
6. **ISSUES:** of course, these folks will be upset and in the end have their needs unaddressed;
8. **ACCESSIBILITY:** [braille labels](https://www.maxiaids.com/reizen-rl-350-braille-labeler) are only a step of distance for a possible future [spin off](https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprint/comments/vf8hrq/comment/icvtlxn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

These factors made me think of E-TKT as more than a solution only for myself, but to everyone.

I wanted to create an open source project for a long time and this is why I put a lot of effort into testing all parts extensively and of course crafting this detailed documentation.


# 🤓 the exploratory side ***...anachronism*** 
...why bother mixing an archaic printing method with current automation and connectivity features? Because *why not?* It was a technological blind spot to be explored!

I've later realized that it was what I’ve been attracted to. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism):
> “An ***anachronism*** (from the Greek ἀνά ana, 'against' and χρόνος khronos, 'time') is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangements, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods”.

The point is: even though the process is digitalized, *the resulting label is totally old school* and there is no easy way of telling if it wasn't made in the traditional way.

## By combining simple and widely available 9mm embossing tapes in a reliable mechanism with modern connectivity, E-TKT rescues a ***would-be future that didn't happen***, and at the same time reduces the dependence on environmentally impacting DRM-enabled disposable cartridges.
