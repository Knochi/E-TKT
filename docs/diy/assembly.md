- attach the Y_stepper motor into the X_bottom with four M3x?? screws. Observe the header direction must look to the PCB;
- place the Y_stepper motor into the X_wall by using two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
- fix the X_wall into the X_bottom by using two M3x?? screws;
- attach the X_pillar to the X_bottom by using one M3x?? screw;
- carefully, snap the X_wall_track between the X_wall and X_pillar;
- create a 90 degree angle for the Y_hall sensor;

- attach the X_pillar to the PCB together with the hall sensor that must be fixed by two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
- join the X_pillar to the PCB and the X_pillar with the Y_hall and place them together into the X_bottom, fixing both pillars with the M3x??;
- proceed to screw three M3x?? to the X_bottom;
- with the help of a nose plier, place the Y_magnet into the X_cube hole to the point it is perfectly levelled; 
- carefully place two M3 nuts into the X_cube to match both holes and insert two M3x?? into it's bottom slit, but just screw lighty (otherwise it will not enter the Y_stepper);
- place the whole X_cube into the stepper observing the axis flat chamfer and then fix both screws lightly;
- turn the X_cube so both M3 screws are looking to the front and the magnet is looking to the hall sensor;
