# üß© **assembly**

### NEMA stepper
- attach the Y_stepper motor into the X_bottom with four M3x?? screws. Observe the header direction must look to the PCB;
- place the Y_stepper motor into the X_wall by using two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
- make a short (~??mm) 4 vias flat cable that connects the NEMA motor in one extremity (usually JST ???) and a 4 via dupont in the other;

### Carousel
- with the help of a nose plier, place the Y_magnet into the X_cube hole to the point it is perfectly levelled; 
- carefully place two M3 nuts into the X_cube to match both holes and insert two M3x?? into it's bottom slit, but just screw lighty (otherwise it will not enter the Y_stepper);
- fully slide the X_cube into the stepper axis observing the flat chamfer fitting and then fix both screws lightly;
- turn around the X_cube so both M3 screws are looking to the front and the magnet is looking to the left (PCB);
- attach the Y_carousel to the top so it's letter "K" is looking to the right (opposite side of the PCB);

### Wall and feed track
- fix the X_wall into the X_bottom by using two M3x?? screws;
- attach the X_pillar to the X_bottom by using one M3x?? screw;
- carefully, snap the X_wall_track between the X_wall and X_pillar;
- connect the stepper cable (5 vias) to the PCB with the red wire aligned to the arrow (?);

### PCB with pillars and hall sensor
- create a 90 degree angle for the Y_hall sensor;
- attach the X_pillar to the PCB together with the hall sensor that must be fixed by two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
- connect the dupont side to the PCB align the cable so it automatically enters the NEMA header;
- join the X_pillar to the PCB and the X_pillar with the Y_hall and place them together into the X_bottom, fixing both pillars with the M3x??;
- proceed to screw three M3x?? to the X_bottom;

### Servo
- attach the servo to the X_bottom with two M3x?? screws, washers and nuts;
- pass it's flat cable to the other side of the wall;

### Display
- solder a 4 vias flat cable to the Y_display and crimp a 4 via dupont connector to the other extremity;
- place the Y_display in the slot observing that the wires hould come from the outermost side, then enclose it with the X_display and two M3x?? screws.

### LEDs
- place one Y_LED into the press slot and make a cable (~??mm) with a 2 vias dupont connnector in the other end;
- do the same for the end slot, but with a (~??mm) cable;

## Feed press
- place the bearings surrounded by M3 washers and fix them with one M3x?? screw and nut.
