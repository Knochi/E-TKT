# üß© **assembly**

### 1. NEMA stepper
1. attach the Y_stepper motor into the X_bottom with four M3x?? screws. Observe the header direction must look to the PCB;
2. place the Y_stepper motor into the X_wall by using two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
3. place the X_steppercover into the Y_stepper motor and use four M3x?? screws to fix; 
4. make a short (~??mm) 4 vias flat cable that connects the NEMA motor in one extremity (usually JST ???) and a 4 via dupont in the other;

### 2. daisy wheel
5. with the help of a nose plier, place the Y_magnet into the X_cube hole to the point it is perfectly levelled; 
6. carefully place two M3 nuts into the X_cube to match both holes and insert two M3x?? into its bottom slit, but just screw lighty (otherwise it will not enter the Y_stepper);
7. fully slide the X_cube into the stepper axis observing the flat chamfer fitting and then fix both screws lightly;
8. turn around the X_cube so both M3 screws are looking to the front and the magnet is looking to the left (PCB);
9. attach the Y_carousel to the top so its letter "K" is looking to the right (opposite side of the PCB);

### 3. wall and feed track
10. fix the X_wall into the X_bottom by using two M3x?? screws;
11. attach the X_pillar to the X_bottom by using one M3x?? screw;
12. carefully, snap the X_wall_track between the X_wall and X_pillar;
13. connect the stepper cable (5 vias) to the PCB with the red wire aligned to the arrow (?);

### 4. PCB with pillars and hall sensor
14. create a 90 degree angle for the Y_hall sensor;
15. attach the X_pillar to the PCB together with the hall sensor that must be fixed by two M3x?? screws, M3 washers and nuts;
16. connect the dupont side to the PCB align the cable so it automatically enters the NEMA header;
17. join the X_pillar to the PCB and the X_pillar with the Y_hall and place them together into the X_bottom, fixing both pillars with the M3x??;
18. proceed to screw three M3x?? to the X_bottom;

### 5. servo
19. attach the servo to the X_bottom with two M3x?? screws, washers and nuts;
20. pass its flat cable to the other side of the wall;
21. place a M6 washer into the X_press slot;
22. ***<< IMPORTANT >> turn on the machine and wait for 30 seconds to make sure the servo is in its rest position***;
23. with the machine still on, gently align the X_press to the servo axis and make sure the side is aligned to the servo vertical wall;
24. place a M3x?? screw with a washer and tighten it;

### 6. display
25. solder a 4 vias flat cable to the Y_display and crimp a 4 via dupont connector to the other extremity;
26. place the Y_display in the slot observing that the wires hould come from the outermost side, then enclose it with the X_display and two M3x?? screws.

## 7. top
27. place one Y_LED into the press slot and make a cable (~??mm) with a 2 vias dupont connnector in the other end;
28. do the same for the end LED slot, but with a (~??mm) cable;
29. carefully align the top into the rest of the structure (attention to the PCB slot);
30. connect the press LED, end LED and display cables into the PCB;
32. with care, fit the top part into the rest of the structure

## 8. feed press
29. place the Y_bearings surrounded by M3 washers and fix them through with one M3x?? screw and nut;
30. position the assembled part into the X_top and use the M3x?? screw transversally until the end;
31. insert the tape into the track until reaching after the feeding cog;
32. lightly screw the M4x?? into the top hole until the tape is secured;
