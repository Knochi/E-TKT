In this first step, we will prepare parts that will be used through all the assembly and interact with multiple subgroups.

## hall sensor

1. if the breakout has a male header, remove it first;
2. solder a 3 pin female 2.54mm header to the breakout;
3. fold hall terminals by 90¬∞ at approximately 7mm from the board, making sure the sensor is perpendicular to the breakout;


## OLED display

- if the breakout has a male/female header, remove it first;
- solder 4 vias flat cable to the breakout;
- ***OBSERVE THE WIRING: in this specific display model, the VCC and GND needed to be switched***;
- crimp 4x female 2.54mm connectors;
- place a 4x plastic case;

*... nevermind the 5x connector case, I didn't have 4x available.*


# NEMA

1. cut the original 4 vias stepper cable
2. crimp it to 4x female 2.54mm connectors;
3. ***OBSERVE THE WIRING: the inner wires should be switched***; ;
4. place a 4x plastic case;

*... again, nevermind the 5 via connector case, I didn't have 4 via available.*

## LEDs

2x led dip (2 vias flat cable to female 2.54)
