# **1. harnesses**

In this first step, we will prepare several parts that will be used through all the assembly, interacting with multiple subgroups.

## hall sensor

1. if the breakout has a male header, remove it first with care;
2. solder a 3x pin female 2.54mm header to the breakout's back face;
3. fold hall terminals by 90¬∞ at approximately 7mm from the board, making sure the sensor is perpendicular to the breakout;


## OLED display

1. if the breakout has a male/female header, remove it first with care;
2. solder a 4x vias flat cable directly to the breakout (there is no space for a header when assembled);
3. ***OBSERVE THE WIRING: in this specific display model, the VCC and GND needs to be switched***;
4. crimp 4x female 2.54mm connectors;
6. as in the above photo point of view, the vias must be: SDA, SCL, VCC, GND.
5. place a 4x plastic case *(nevermind the 5x connector case, I didn't have 4x available)*;


# NEMA

1. cut the original 4 vias stepper cable to use the extremity that connects to the motor;
2. crimp 4x female 2.54mm connectors;
3. ***OBSERVE THE WIRING: the inner wires should be switched***; ;
4. place a 4x plastic case *(nevermind the 5x connector case, I didn't have 4x available)*;


## LEDs

1. cut the terminals of the two DIP LEDs;
2. solder each LED to a 2 vias flat cable
3. I recommend to use individual thermo retractable sleeves for each terminal to avoid short circuits
4. ***do not crimp the connector yet, we will need to pass the cables before that.***
