# **2. daisy wheel**

5. with the help of a nose plier, place the Y_magnet into the X_cube hole to the point it is perfectly levelled; 
6. carefully place two M3 nuts into the X_cube to match both holes and insert two M3x?? into its bottom slit, but just screw lighty (otherwise it will not enter the Y_stepper);
7. fully slide the X_cube into the stepper axis observing the flat chamfer fitting and then fix both screws lightly;
8. turn around the X_cube so both M3 screws are looking to the front and the magnet is looking to the left (PCB);
9. attach the Y_carousel to the top so its letter "K" is looking to the right (opposite side of the PCB);
