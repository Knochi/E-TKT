# **2. NEMA**

![_DSC0500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/196174941-3c4be757-cb8c-40b8-80c9-3585ac24ea61.jpg)

In this first step, we will prepare the NEMA stepper sub-assembly, responsible for the daisy wheel character selection.

## cover

1. place the H_nema_cover on top of the NEMA stepper motor, and fix it with 4x m3x6 screws.

## magnet polarity

We need to know the right polarity to trigger the hall sensor, otherwise the device will not be able to home itself.

1. for that, temporarily mount the hall sensor breakout into the PCB and turn it on;
2. avoiding any short circuits, pass the magnet extremities to the sensor, **carefully**;
3. when the right side is found, mark it with a pen;
4. turn the PCB off and then disassemble the hall sensor breakout;


## wheel hub

1. with the help of a plier, place the magnet into the I_nema_wheel_hub with the mark outside;
2. the magnet must be leveled to the surface, otherwise it might hit the sensor when rotating;

3. now, place 2x m3 nuts into the slit underneath the I_nema_wheel_hub;
4. a plier is helpfull for the initial insertion, then an allen wrench helps to slide it in;
5. be careful with the second nut, otherwise it may go beyond its proper spot;

6. place 2x m3x8 screws just to make sure they grab the nuts, but do not fasten them yet;

7. slide the cube to the stepper motor, making sure the chamfer matches both parts;
8. if you have having trouble, make sure the screws are not tightned;
9. again, do not fasten the screws, we will have then tightened later.
