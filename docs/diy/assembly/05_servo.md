# **5. servo**

The servo, together with the hall sensor, is one of the most critical sub systems of the device.

***Please, be focused and follow thoroughly.***

## servo + PCB

1. it is advisable to roll the excess cable with a wire strap to keep it tidy;
2. the correct connector order when facing the PCB is: GND (brown), VCC (red), SIGNAL (orange);
3. use an allen key to help push it to the header.


## servo: homing

Servos receive PWM signals to reach directly to a specific angle, in this case from 0 to 180 degrees.

It is unpredictable in which angle a given unit is delivered to you. Because of that, we'll be turning the machine on to make sure it is homed in the resting angle.

1. make sure you have already flashed both the firmware and data files (SPIFFS) into the PCB;
2. connect the display to the PCB;
3. plug the 12DC power source into the PCB;
4. wait for the "E-TKT" splash animation and the servo will be homed to its resting position.

## P_press

1. place a m6 washer into the P_press;
2. this is intended to ease the movement between the P_press while keeping it perpendicular to the servo axis;


## P_press: alignment

Now that the servo is homed, we can put the P_press by using its own visual cue.

1. don't forget to keep the device connected to the power source;
2. place the servo on a surface longitudinally;
3. use the lateral line of the P_press to keep it aligned;
4. aim the P_press hole to the servo hub and press gently until fitting it;
5. *do not twist, we need to "carve" the P_press plastic to the "cog" shape of the hub!*
6. place an m3x6 with washer and screw tightly
7. there must be absolutely no lateral play (force it a bit to test) between the servo and the P_press, otherwise it will miss the daisy wheel's tooth when forced.

1. disconnect the power source from the PCB;
2. remove the display and reserve it;
3. to ease mounting the servo on the A_bottom, place 2x nuts and pass 2x m3x20 with washers;
4. screw both lightly, just to grab the nuts onto the other side;
5. keep a gap between the washers and the A_bottom;
6. align the servo to both screws and "click" it through;
7. tighten both screws while making sure the servo is as inward and pressed against to the A_bottom as possible;



## result & check

Just to make sure the P_press is aligned: with the machine turned off, twist the press a bit and turn the device on again.

***It should home to rest position. That means the lateral of the P_press should be 100% vertical, together with the servo outline.***

If not, you will need to print another P_press and repeat the previous steps.
