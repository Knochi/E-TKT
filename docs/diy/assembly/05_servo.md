# **5. servo**

19. attach the servo to the X_bottom with two M3x?? screws, washers and nuts;
20. pass its flat cable to the other side of the wall;
21. place a M6 washer into the X_press slot;
22. ***<< IMPORTANT >> turn on the machine and wait for the splash screen to make sure the servo is in its rest position***;
23. with the machine still on, gently align the P_press to the servo axis and make sure the side is aligned to the servo vertical wall;
24. place a M3x?? screw with a washer and tighten it;


Important: depending on the servo dimensions there might be some misalignments between the tip of the P_press and the daisy wheel teeth.
For that, try assembling first with the P_press, but if needed you can try the P_press_ or the P_press (or even customize the 3d printing by yourself)
