1. start by picking the device from the side, as indicated above;
2. make sure the magnet on the I_nema_wheel_hub is facing the hall sensor, which also means the both I_nema_wheel_hub screws are are looking to you;
3. ***pay attention now*** 
4. align the bottom part of the daisy wheel (with the teeth) to have the letter "J" facing the P_press on the right;
5. that will also mean the wheel's only big tooth (for cutting) will be facing you, together with to both I_nema_wheel_hub screws;
6. "click" the daisy wheel into the I_nema_wheel_hub;
