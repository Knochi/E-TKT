# **9. finish**

These are the few last steps.

PS: the wheel cover serves for removing the daisy wheel without needing to disassemble anything else.


## wheel cover

1. slide the M_top_wheel_cover into the J_top;
2. use 2x m3x10 screws to lightly touch the bearing, but we will finish tightening them on the final step;


## D_pillar

1. use 2x m3x20 screws to fix the D_pillar against the A_bottom and J_top;


## wheel hub height

1. as you might already have noticed, the daisy wheel might be lose, but we needed to have the whole structure stable before adjusting it;
2. rotate the daisy wheel assembly until you find a chamfer on the bottom of the I_nema_wheel_hub;
3. place a scredriver to leverage the I_nema_wheel_hub against the H_nema_cover;
4. while keeping it up, tighten very whell both screws of the I_nema_wheel_hub;
5. also, tighten both screws on the M_top_wheel_cover;
6. test to see if the daisy wheel is properly fixed, without clearance.


## üéà congratulations, now we are ready to proceed to connecting it, adding a reel adn calibrating!
