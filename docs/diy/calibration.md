# ‚è±Ô∏è **calibration**

This final part of the process will make sure the letter alignment is finely adjusted, and together with the correct imprinting pressure.

Only when fully assembled and revised:
- turn your E-TKT on;
- after the splash screen the machine will home by rotating until the magnet meets the hall sensor;
- wait until it is finished and then...

## **<< attention is needed here, please >>**

Check the letter "J" position in the top window: if the letter is visually centered (right image), then proceed to the step 4.

- **<< TURN OFF the device >>** otherwise you might short circuit the hall sensor terminals;
- delicately adjust the hall sensor position following the tangent (cyan) axis in the image:
  - if "J" is too much to the right, push the hall sensor inward the device (yellow);
  - if "J" is too much to the left, pull the hall sensor outward the device (magenta);
- make sure to keep the same distance on the transversal (red) axis;
- only when the letter "J" is visually centered in the top window, you might proceed to the next step;

Also, when turning the machine on, the press angle should be at 2mm from the I_nema_wheel_hub. If not, then you might need to go back to the [press assembly procedure](https://andreisperid.github.io/E-TKT/diy/assembly/04_servo.html).

## fine tuning

- check the display and follow the instructions to connect the machine to your local area network;
- again, follow the display to open the web app (IP or QR code) and when loaded click on "settings";
- you will see a xray of the machine, and now we will take care of the first part of the calibration which is the alignment (magenta).

### Alignment
- the align values ranges from 1 to 9, having 5 as a default (middle).
- now click the "TEST" button to the right side of "align";
- the machine will slowly and lightly press the carousel letter;
- the goal is to have the press to be fully aligned with the character, that should also be right in the middle of the character window;
- adjust the values and test to make sure it is alright;

### Force
- now we will adjust the peak servo angle, that will determine if the letter will be lightly or heavily pressed against the tape;
- the default value is 1 in a scale from 1 to 9;
- increase it one at a time and hit the big test button;
- take the opportunity to see if the alignment is correct, and if not adjust it too;


### üïê when you are happy with the result, click save and wait for the machine to reboot.
