# ⏱️ **calibration**

This final part of the process will make sure the letter alignment is finely adjusted, and together with the correct imprinting pressure.

Only when fully assembled and revised:
- turn your E-TKT on;
- after the splash screen the machine will home by rotating until the magnet meets the hall sensor;
- wait until it is finished and then...

## << attention is needed here, please >>

Check the letter "?" position: if the letter is totally inside the window (ideally roughly centered), then proceed to the step 4.

***In case the letter "?" is not totally inside the window, you must << TURN OFF >> the machine and delicately adjust the hall sensor lateral position so that when the machine is homed, the letter "?" is fully inside.***

Also, when turning the machine on, the press angle should be as there would be approximately one milimeter between it and the X_cube. If it is not, then you might need to redo the assembly step #?? or adjust the rest_angle on the firmware.

- check the display and follow the instructions to connect the machine to your local area network;
- again, follow the display to open the web app (IP or QR code) and when loaded click on "settings";
- you will see a xray of the machine, and now we will take care of the first part of the calibration which is the alignment (magenta).

### Alignment
- the align values ranges from 1 to 9, having 5 as a default (middle).
- now click the "TEST" button to the right side of "align";
- the machine will slowly and lightly press the carousel letter;
- the goal is to have the press to be fully aligned with the character, that should also be right in the middle of the character window;
- adjust the values and test to make sure it is alright;

### Force
- now we will adjust the peak servo angle, that will determine if the letter will be lightly or heavily pressed against the tape;
- the default value is 1 in a scale from 1 to 9;
- increase it one at a time and hit the big test button;
- take the opportunity to see if the alignment is correct, and if not adjust it too;


### 🕐 when you are happy with the result, click save and wait for the machine to reboot.
