# 💻 **firmware**

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/andreisperid/E-TKT);
2. Make sure you have the framework and all the libraries installed on your computer (I've used [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and recommend it!);
3. Flash the code into the ESP32 using an USB-C cable;
4. Upload the files ("data" folder) to the ESP32 using SPIFFS.
