To make your own E-TKT you will need to:
### 1. 3D print
I highly recommend you to have a *3d printer accessible* as you might need to test and tweak the printing settings, since this project demands a certain precision in the fittings;
  
### 2. order a PCB
It's design was oriented to *low cost manufacturing* (4 layers). The two internal layers are ground planes, so it might work with only 2 layers for even lower costs (but it wasn't tested). Don't forget to *order a stencil for the front face* (not needed for the back) together with the PCB.

### 3. buy components
For some electronic parts, you might need to search for alternative *drop-in replacements* (same specs & footprint) as right now there is a general shortage for semiconductors.

### 4. mount the components on the PCB
You can place the components manually in the PCB and then use a home electrical oven/toaster to solder the SMD components. There are PTH headers in the back face and a single SMD electrolytical capacitor that will be easy to deal with a simple soldering station.

### 5. flash the firmware
Very simple process, but please don't forget to *add the data files* together with the firmware.

### 6. assemble the whole package
After making sure the system is working properly, you can proceed to *cable management and physically mounting* the parts together.

### 7. calibrate
The final step makes sure the daisy wheel letters are aligned to the tape and works along with the right pressing force. There is a handy *calibration mode built-in the web app* ;)

*PS: the PCB order along with the components and it's assembly (steps 2, 3 and 4) might be outsourced by using a turnkey PCB service, but it is funnier to DIY to learn by doing!*
