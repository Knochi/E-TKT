# **PCB version 0.9** / July, 2022

----

First of all, I'd like to start by saying a big thank you to [Wesley Lee](https://github.com/wes06), an inspiring old friend of mine that gave me a lot of tips, suggestions and lessons about PCB design.

Among several improvements, these were the major changes for this 0.9 version that already went into production:

- **Bucket 6V regulato:** Wes suggested using it instead of a linear regulator (big drop from 12V to 6V), and why not? I've ended up learning a little bit about EMI;
- **Latch power switch:** Wes also suggested that by sending me this reference from Dave's EEV Blog. Initially I was looking to use a MOSFET + small slide switch, but being able to use the same tact button as the other commands for that was a nice idea.
- **Visual identity:** in a serendipitous coincidence I've found the superposition of routing tracks+ vias + the real scale "E-TKT" logo a great sum of what "anachronical" is. And this is all about a designer doing a PCB: I bent a little bit the best routes just for making it conceptual. We'll need to see the readability between the solder mask + FR4 + ENIG, but I think it will be alright. Also, I've done custom graphics for the commands, inspired by teenage engineering (I'll get there one day...).
- **Improved edge cuts:** thanks again to Wes, now with proper achievable fillets and mouse bites;
- **Buzzer:** because why not? Maybe simple quick tones as feedbacks;
- **Hierarchical sheets:** not exactly on the PCB itself, but I've loved organizing the subsystems in modules, easing its reutilization.
